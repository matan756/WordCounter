      "Enter some text:  Two grenadiers were marching back to France They had been held captive in Russia, And when they reached German lands They hung their heads in shame.  For here they learnt the sorry tale That France had been conquered in war, Her valiant army beaten and shattered, And the Emperor, the Emperor captured.  The grenadiers then wept together, As they heard of these sad tidings. The first said: ‘Ah, the agony; How my old wound is burning!’  The second said: ‘This is the end; If only we could die together. But I’ve a wife and child at home, And they would perish without me.’  ‘To hell with wife, to hell with child, My aims are for far higher things; Let them beg, if they’ve nothing to eat— My Emperor, my Emperor captured!  ‘Grant me, brother, one request, If I am now to die. Take my corpse with you to France; Bury me in French soil.\n"
